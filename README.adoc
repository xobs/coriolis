# Coriolis README


Coriolis is a free database, placement tool and routing tool for VLSI designs.


## Purpose

Coriolis provides several tools to perform the layout of VLSI circuits.  Its
main components are the Hurricane database, the Etesian placer and the Kite
router, but other tools can use the Hurricane database and the parsers
provided.

The user interface <cgt> is the prefered way to use Coriolis, but all
Coriolis tools are Python modules and thus scriptables.


## Documentation

The complete documentation is available here, both in pdf & html:

   ./documentation/UsersGuide/UsersGuide.html
   ./documentation/UsersGuide/UsersGuide.pdf

The documentation of the latest *stable* version is also
available online. It may be quite outdated from the *devel*
version.

## Building Coriolis

On Ubuntu 18.04, install the necessary packages:

````sh
sudo apt install cmake libxml2-dev python3-dev libboost-python-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-wave-dev libqt4-dev liblemon-dev libbz2-dev rapidjson-dev
````

Build order:

1. vlsisapd
1. coloquinte
1. hurricane
1. crlcore
1. cumulus
1. equinox
1. knik
1. katabatic
1. kite
1. etesian
1. nimbus
1. metis
1. mauka
1. solstice
1. stratus1
1. unicorn
1. ispd

For each directory, do the following:

```sh
cd ${dir}
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/coriolis -DPYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES=lib/python3/dist-packages -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make all install
cd ../..
```

## Using Coriolis

The Coriolis main interface can be launched with the command: ::

    ego@home:~: ~/coriolis-2.x/<OS>.<DISTRIB>/Release.Shared/install/bin/coriolis

The ``coriolis`` script is tasked to guess it's location and setup appropriatly
the UNIX environment, then lauch ``cgt`` (or *any* command, with the
``--run=<COMMAND>`` option).

Conversely, you can setup the current shell environement for Coriolis by 
using the helper ``coriolisEnv.py``, then run any Coriolis tool: ::

    ego@home:~$ eval `~/coriolis-2.x/src/coriolis/bootstrap/coriolisEnv.py`
    ego@home:~$ cgt -V
